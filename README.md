# Deep-Feature-Interporlation-Glasses-Remove-TensorFlow
A simple implementation of the paper 'Deep Feature Interpolation for Image Content Changes'
# Introduction
This code is simple to read, which mainly implement the paper [Deep Feature Interpolation for Image Content Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05507). This method mainly address the problem of face attribute manipulation, e.g. glasses remove, change age, mouth close2open, etc.
